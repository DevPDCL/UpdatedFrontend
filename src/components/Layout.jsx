// Copy supplied verbatim by the SEO team. Do not paraphrase or re-clamp — the
// exact characters are the deliverable. The missing space in "Bangladesh|" is
// theirs to correct; a query is open with them.
//
// These two strings are also mirrored as static tags in index.html, so that
// crawlers which never execute JS (Facebook, LinkedIn, WhatsApp) see real copy
// instead of an empty #root. Keep the two in sync: nothing breaks mechanically
// if they drift, but the copy those crawlers read would stop matching what the
// page actually renders, which is the entire reason for duplicating it.
//
// Why the static tags don't produce duplicates: each carries data-rh="true",
// the attribute react-helmet-async stamps on tags it owns. On mount its
// updateTags() collects every [data-rh] tag in <head>, keeps the ones matching
// a tag it wants to render, and removes the rest — so it takes ownership of
// them. og:type/og:site_name/twitter:card match the App shell in main.jsx
// exactly and are adopted in place; the three carrying homepage copy are
// removed and re-appended once, because Layout is lazy-loaded and the shell
// commits its generic fallback first. Either way the settled DOM holds exactly
// one correct tag of each. Verified with tag-count assertions across /, a
// branch page, a doctor page and the error route.
